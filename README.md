## Overview

This is a simple quiz that tests your knowledge of Javascript with 5 multiple choice questions. The goal is to try and answer all questions correctly in as little time as possible. Getting the answer wrong deducts 10 seconds off the clock, which is also 10 points of your final score. It's exhiliarating!

**Motivation:** The goal was to show a real-world application of my newly learned Javascript skills (Iterating over arrays, writing For loops, working with different variable scopes, nested loops and nested functions, complex if/else statements, object methods, DOM element manipulation, writing and reading to/from local storage, using setInterval to run a timer and much more).

All game logic written completely in javascript!
